            <p>
              Tangub was established as a municipality on February 28, 1930, under Executive Order No. 162, signed by then-Governor General Dwight F. Davis. It was later converted into a city on June 17, 1967, through Republic Act No. 5138, becoming the 50th city in the Philippines. Historically, the city’s name is believed to have originated from the word “Tangub,” which means “cave” or “hideout,” as early settlers used the area’s natural caves for shelter and protection.
              <br>
              <br>
              Through the decades, Tangub evolved from a small coastal town to a progressive city known for its vibrant culture and economic contributions. The city has faced challenges, such as natural disasters and economic downturns, but its people’s resilience has driven its recovery and growth. Tangub’s history is deeply tied to its community’s strong sense of unity and their commitment to preserving the traditions that have shaped its identity.
